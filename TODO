Proof of concept:
    ☐ Need to create proper names for the commands
    ☐ Create a WebView which is able to show some input boxes
    ☐ Build the find context in the WebView
    ☐ Build an initial replace mechanism in the WebView

View related:
    ☐ Figure out how to add to the find replace side bar
    ☐ Add a text box for the context choice
    ☐ Add some inputs for the find replace and other functions
    ☐ Remove all of the `calicoColor` references
